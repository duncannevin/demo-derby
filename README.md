### Prerequisites

### Let's get started,

* Used any of the sbt commands listed in the below according to the requirement which are working fine with this application.(To see more details of [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/))

``` 
    sbt clean           # Clear existing build files
    
    sbt stage           # Build your application from your projectâ€™s source directory
    
    sbt run             # Run both backend and frontend builds in watch mode
    
    sbt dist            # Build both backend and frontend sources into a single distribution
    
    sbt test            # Run both backend and frontend unit tests 
```
